buster's method: fraction of paths that lead to destination

can we get the airport network? -city (node), edge (flight)
	-compare random, distance, and learned network
	-weight edges by number of flights
		-multigraph

greyhound/bus network as well (later)

incorporate clustering


^does airport network correlate to gowalla?
	-P(community|airport)
	-P(link|air-link)
	-get hubs [community point]

try 100/1000 random nodes (higher distance bins, not friends)

for airport network: census, city, location, population, etc... [elevation, rainfall]
